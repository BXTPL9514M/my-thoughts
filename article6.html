    <h1>Is the World Full of Rumours — or Is the World Itself a Rumour?</h1>

    <p>
      There are many rumours in this world. But sometimes I wonder—what if the
      world itself is a rumour? The idea feels strange at first, yet the more
      you think about it, the more it begins to make sense.
    </p>

    <p>
      Almost everything we believe is something we were told. Passed down by
      ancestors, teachers, books, and systems we never questioned. We follow
      ideas not because we verified them, but because they existed before we
      were old enough to doubt.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are told different things at different times, rarely the complete
      truth—mostly versions of it. Once a version survives long enough, it
      becomes fact. Take evolution, for example. We are told that humans evolved
      from apes. Maybe it is true. Maybe it is incomplete. Maybe it is only the
      closest explanation humanity could reach with limited understanding.
    </p>

    <p>
      Is questioning that wrong? I do not think so. Every day, we trust people
      we do not truly know—drivers, pilots, barbers, doctors. Strangers who hold
      our lives for a moment. Trust has become a habit, not a choice.
    </p>

    <p>
      What is strange is that we question emotions, beliefs, and faith more than
      we question systems and scientific truths. Maybe because systems feel
      safe, while uncertainty feels dangerous.
    </p>

    <p>
      What if humanity is still early in understanding itself? What if our
      explanations are not wrong—but unfinished? Maybe the real danger is not
      believing something incorrect, but believing that there is nothing left
      to discover.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the world is a rumour, then certainty is a rumour too. And if certainty
      is a rumour, then questioning may be the most honest thing a human can do.
