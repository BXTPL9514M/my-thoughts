      <h3>A World Without Rain, But Full of Lightning</h3>
      <p>
        A reflection on invisible systems, quiet manipulation,
        and the illusion of freedom we rarely stop to examine.

  <h3>Is the World Full of Rumours — or Is the World Itself a Rumour?</h3>

  <section class="content about">

    <h2 class="section-title">Why This Exists</h2>

    <p>
      This website is not a blog, a brand, or a place for answers.
      It exists as a record of thoughts that feel uncomfortable,
      unfinished, and necessary.
    </p>

    <p>
      I believe questioning the world is more important than
      adjusting to it. If something here makes you pause,
      then it has done its job.
