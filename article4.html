    <h1>The Comfort of Judging Others</h1>

    <p>
      Ever wondered how we decide our worth among people—or among crowds? Most of
      the time, our thoughts are not really our own. They are shaped by how
      others react to us. We become so focused on being watched that we slowly
      lose control over how we behave in front of people.
    </p>

    <p>
      In trying to fit in, we forget who we actually are. Instead of
      understanding ourselves, we become interested in judging others. We
      observe how people behave toward us or toward someone else, and we
      silently decide who deserves respect and who does not.
    </p>

    <p>
      People judge because others are different. And when someone cannot be
      understood or controlled, the easiest response is disrespect. Sometimes
      it appears as frustration, sometimes as silence, and sometimes as anger
      that is carried home and released onto the people closest to us.
    </p>

    <p>
      These are the people who love us, who respect us, and who rarely speak
      against us. Yet they become the ones who suffer most. We hurt them
      because they feel safe to hurt.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now imagine being on the other side. Imagine being the person who is
      judged, disrespected, or emotionally unloaded on for no real reason. How
      would that feel? Not fair. Not justified. Not deserved.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yet this is human nature. There is a strange comfort in watching others
      suffer—it feels distant, almost entertaining. But the moment that
      suffering turns toward us, it suddenly becomes cruelty.
    </p>

    <p>
      Maybe growth begins when we stop enjoying judgment and start questioning
      why we need it at all.
