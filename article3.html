    <h1>There Is Always a Tomorrow</h1>

    <p>
      There is always a tomorrow—whether you are alive to see it or not. That
      thought alone is unsettling. Yet every morning, most of us wake up with
      the same mindset, following the same routine, without ever questioning
      why we are doing what we do.
    </p>

    <p>
      We go to school, college, or office. Not because we deeply understand the
      purpose, but because we are told it leads to money. And money, we are made
      to believe, leads to survival. So we keep running—not toward meaning, but
      toward payment.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the end, we work to get paid, and then pay others who are also working
      to get paid. Money itself is just paper. It has no value unless it is
      exchanged. Still, people kill for it. Lives are taken for something that
      means nothing on its own.
    </p>

    <p>
      When did survival turn into a competition where violence feels justified?
      Is the goal to eliminate everyone else until only one person remains,
      holding all the money and all the power?
    </p>

    <p>
      Power grows where money gathers. And with power comes the desire to rise
      higher—often by pushing others down. Some people already hold most of this
      power, and instead of ending the race, they fuel it further. They do not
      want equality. They want control.
    </p>

    <p>
      This makes me question something deeper. Are we really working for
      ourselves? Or are we unknowingly working for someone else’s system,
      someone else’s survival game? We move every day, exhausted, unaware of who
      truly benefits from our effort.
    </p>

    <p>
      And maybe the most frightening part is not the system itself—but how
      rarely we stop to question it.
