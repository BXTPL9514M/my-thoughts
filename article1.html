    <h1>A World Without Rain, But Full of Lightning</h1>

    <p>
      There is something strangely beautiful about the weather when there is no
      rain, yet lightning fills the sky. No clouds above us, but still a powerful
      force moving silently. It makes me think about how the world works beneath
      the surface—about things we feel but never fully understand.
    </p>

    <p>
      I believe that all of us are connected in ways we don’t talk about. Not
      through words, but through thoughts, patterns, and shared fears. Yet we
      never try to go deeper into this connection. Maybe not because we can’t,
      but because we are quietly discouraged from doing so.
    </p>

    <p>
      The world we live in feels guided by people who understand these systems
      far better than we do. They don’t need violence or fear to control us.
      They use structure, routine, and dependence. These are the real “dark
      knights” of the modern world—not villains in shadows, but forces hidden
      in plain sight.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are placed inside an invisible box. Not a prison with walls, but one
      made of expectations. Inside it, we work, compete, and move in circles—
      like rats chasing bait that always stays just out of reach. We are told
      this is life.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most of us never truly see the world for what it is. And sometimes I fear
      that we never will. Not because escape is impossible, but because it is
      made to feel unnecessary, unrealistic, or dangerous.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even our parents are part of this system. Not because they want to harm
      us, but because their own lives were shaped the same way. When our future
      is placed in their hands, and they are already trapped in the cycle, the
      cycle continues. We are sent to schools not to question the system, but to
      learn how to function inside it.
