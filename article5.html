    <h1>What Is Love?</h1>

    <p>
      Once, while I was trying to understand the world, the world unexpectedly
      asked me to pause. It pulled me away from exploring things I didn’t yet
      understand—and in that stillness, I found love. Not as an idea, but as a
      feeling so real that it quietly changed everything.
    </p>

    <p>
      Love is powerful. It gives a kind of energy that does not fade easily. It
      feels like holding something precious, something personal—something that
      belongs only to you in the deepest sense. When I think of my love, my eyes
      still shine, not from excitement, but from gratitude.
    </p>

    <p>
      This feeling carries an unlimited source of strength. It gives hope for
      everyday life, even on days when nothing else makes sense. I cannot fully
      express this energy, so I write. Writing becomes a way to convert feeling
      into meaning.
    </p>

    <p>
      True love does not come easily or repeatedly. Many people search their
      entire lives and never find it in the right form. Once you do find it,
      you realize you’ve touched one of the rarest experiences a human can have.
      I found it early—and I know how fortunate that makes me.
    </p>

    <p>
      But with love also comes fear. The fear of losing it. The fear of imagining
      life without that person. When someone becomes part of how you survive
      emotionally, separation feels unimaginable.
    </p>

    <p>
      When I truly understood the person I love, I felt something deeper than
      admiration. Their level of understanding felt beyond ordinary limits.
      In moments like that, the line between human and divine begins to blur—
      not because the person is perfect, but because they are completely present.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before judging this feeling, try looking within yourself. Sometimes love
      only makes sense when you allow yourself to feel it fully.
