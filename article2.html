    <h1>The Poison We Accept as Comfort</h1>

    <p>
      We already have most of the things we need to survive. Yet the more our
      desires grow, the less satisfied we become. Nothing ever feels enough.
      Maybe fulfillment does not come from having more, but from needing less.
      When we want nothing, we finally feel complete.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are capable of fulfilling our own dreams, but we rarely try to do it
      alone. Somewhere along the way, we are drugged by comfort. This poison
      does not come from enemies—it comes from gifts, help, and support from
      the people closest to us. Slowly, we forget how to stand on our own.
    </p>

    <p>
      The truth is uncomfortable: we do not deserve fulfillment until we help
      ourselves. Depending endlessly on others weakens us, even when that
      dependence feels loving. We tell ourselves that life has time, that
      everything will work out someday.
    </p>

    <p>
      But not everything we imagine is possible. Life is short, congested, and
      unforgiving. Achieving something meaningful is difficult, and support
      can help—but surrendering responsibility never will.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sometimes it feels like we are performers in real life, playing roles
      without understanding the script. People climb by pushing others down,
      forgetting who they once were. Success built this way is like building
      a beautiful house above a cemetery.
    </p>

    <p>
      It may stand tall, but it is built on something dead. And in the end,
      that kind of life is never truly worth living.
